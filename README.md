An application for Spatial Cartilage Outcomes detected on B-mode Ultrasound images of femoral trochlear cartilage health. This application was built so it can be (hopefully) easily adapted by researchers with hopes of standardizing data processing schemes to improve the clinical utility of ultrasound imaging for assessments of femoral trochlea cartilage health.

The goal was to create a foundation that continue to be expanded upon collectively as our understanding of common ultrasound metrics improves with more rigorous and standardized guidelines and methodologies....

This program was built in MATLAB 2021a for windows. Source code, standalone version, and documentation are available. <br />
